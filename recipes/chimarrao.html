<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Chimarrão is a traditional South American drink that is particularly popular in Brazil, The drink is prepared by placing the dried yerba mate leaves in a special hollowed-out gourd called a cuia. The cuia is typically made from a type of squash or wood and is often decorated with intricate designs.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1-2 tablespoons of dried yerba mate leaves</li>
    <li>Hot water (not boiling to don't burn the leaves)</li>
    <li>Sugar(my advice, do not add it, it's like a pineapple on the pizza for a Italian)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Fill the gourd: Start by filling the chimarrão gourd with dried yerba mate leaves. Fill it about two-thirds full, leaving some space at the top.</li>
    <li>Insert the bombilla: Insert the bombilla into the gourd, making sure it reaches the bottom, where the yerba mate leaves are piled up.</li>
    <li>Curing: Slowly pour hot water (not boiling) into the gourd, taking care not to wet the bombilla. Pour the water onto the slope of the leaves, allowing them to absorb the water. Let it sit for a few seconds. This step is known as "curing" and helps prepare the yerba mate for drinking.</li>
    <li>Enjoy it!!!</li>
